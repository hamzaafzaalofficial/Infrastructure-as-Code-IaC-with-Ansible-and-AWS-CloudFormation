# Infrastructure-as-Code-IaC-with-Ansible-and-AWS-CloudFormation

# Tasks
Write a CloudFormation template for a multi-tier setup.
Use Ansible to deploy, update, and manage the stack.



# Step 1: Create CloudFormation Template
Create a CloudFormation template that defines your multi-tier setup. For example, you might have three tiers: a web tier, an application tier, and a database tier. The template will include resources such as EC2 instances, load balancers, databases, security groups, etc., and define the relationships between these resources.



# Step 2: Create Ansible Playbook for Deployment
Create a file named deploy.yaml for deploying the CloudFormation stack.


# Step 3: Execute Deployment Command
Run the following command to deploy the stack:
ansible-playbook deploy.yaml # To deploy the stack
ansible-playbook update.yaml # To update the stack if needed



# Future Recommendations:

1)  Compare using the IAC and configuration management tool Ansible against doing all the provisioning and configuring manually, given that you have to do infrastructure setup of say for 100 applications.  What would you choose?
2) Think of the role of ansible playbook in this?
3) What is role of CloudFormation in this?
